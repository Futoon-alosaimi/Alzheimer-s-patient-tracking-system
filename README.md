# Alzheimer-s-patient-tracking-system
Losing navigational skills or getting lost is a big trouble for the Alzheimer's patients and their families. Because of the nature of the illness, Alzheimer's patients tend to lose their memories of the familiar places, their relatives, and the right path to their homes. The main idea of our project is to develop a wearable tracking system which will help families or caretakers to locate the Alzheimer patients easily and quickly. Thus, we propose a new tracking system which will use the Arduino, GSM, and GPS technologies. GPS technology used to retrieve the current location of the patient. When GSM receive a predefined message from the caretaker it will send the GPS location of the patient to the caretaker via SMS. The caretaker could set a specific range for the patient to be in, if the patient left the area an alarming message will be sent to the caretaker. We further aim, at developing an elegant, small, portable and low-cost tracking device.
